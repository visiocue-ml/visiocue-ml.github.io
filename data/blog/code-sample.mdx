Visiocue GmbH, based in Berlin and funded by the Beumer group, is transforming the cargo and aviation sectors with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. Our mission is to safeguard operational efficiency by detecting anomalies in luggage that could disrupt conveyor belt mechanics. By proactively identifying issues before they escalate, we are setting new standards for safety and reliability in baggage handling.

Our operations integrate an array of advanced sensors, including LiDAR and high-definition RGB cameras, to capture comprehensive data on every piece of luggage. This data is processed on the edge, enabling real-time analysis and swift decision-making. The seamless fusion of sensor technology and AI allows us to detect irregularities—such as unexpected size, shape, or extended handles—thereby preventing mechanical disruptions and enhancing overall throughput.

At the core of our solution lies a robust machine learning framework that leverages modern computer vision techniques. This framework processes vast amounts of visual and spatial data to accurately differentiate between normal and anomalous luggage features. By continuously refining our models with real-world data, we ensure that our system not only operates efficiently but also adapts to emerging challenges in cargo and aviation environments.

Our commitment to precision is underscored by a system accuracy of 99%, ensuring that almost every anomaly is correctly identified. This high precision is maintained through rigorous analysis of key performance metrics, including True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN). The infographic below offers a visual summary of our performance along with icons and definitions for the core components—LiDAR sensors and RGB cameras—that drive our solution.
